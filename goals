- Analyse the data to see what metrics predict frog populations over time:
    -> Inundation
    -> Water flow
    -> Different types of water bodys: creeks, permenant, ephemeral
    -> Climate
    -> Horse numbers?
    -> Local habitat components? (how often have they been measured):
        -- we should use the habitat
        -- Get together with Lou to look into habitat across sites
    -> What are the differences between sites: can we see any difference?
    -> Value of predictions for meeting certain thresholds? (e.g. x amount of water and precipitation needed for y length breeding season/calling period)

- Environmental Water Management Plan update last June:
    -> What are the goals for the frogs?
    -> Breeding duration (based on call rates)

- Acoustic Model sensitivity and specificity (ability to detect frogs): E.g. how good is our ability to detect certain species.

- Descriptive (What's happening?) (e.g. trands over time in occ/calls)
- Analytical (Why's it happening?) (e.g. how much of an effect is the hydrological conditions having)
- Evaluative (against goals)... are current management systems allowing suitable occupancy/call rates; what works well what doesn't
- Evaluative: How good is our acoustic classifier model/ Are we oversampling/undersampling.
