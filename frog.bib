   abstract = {Obtaining unbiased estimates of wildlife distribution and abundance is an important objective in research and management. Occupancy and N-mixture abundance models, which correct for imperfect detection, are commonly used for this purpose. Fitting these models in a Bayesian framework has advantages but doing so can be challenging and time-consuming for many researchers. We developed an R package, ubms, which provides an easy-to-use, formula-based interface for fitting occupancy, N-mixture abundance and other models in a Bayesian framework using Stan. The package also provides tools for visualizing parameter effects, calculating residuals, assessing goodness-of-fit and comparing models. We demonstrate the use of ubms by fitting an N-mixture model to ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus count data from drumming surveys conducted at roadside points sampled on five occasions annually during 2013â€“2015. To demonstrate the functionality of ubms, we used survey site as a random effect, and occasion date and per cent aspen cover at each site as covariates of detection and abundance respectively. The top-ranked model included a positive effect of per cent aspen on grouse abundance. ubms has the potential to greatly increase the range of users who will be able to rigorously assess species distribution and abundance while correcting for imperfect detection in a Bayesian framework.},

   abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected when present. Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark-recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.},

   abstract = {Local regression models provide methods for fitting regression functions, or regression surfaces, to data. The chapter describes the specifications of a particular model determine the details of the method used to fit the model; the fitting method, which is called loess. It discusses the S functions and objects for local regression models by working through a number of examples. Our goal is to show how the data are analyzed in practice using S. This means we must discuss diagnostic methods. Thus, diagnostic checking is an essential part of the practice of fitting local regression models, and, as with all model building, omitting it results in demonstrated validity being replaced simply by hope. Thus, the fitting of local regression models involves making the following choices about the specification of properties of the errors and the regression surface. Properties are Gaussian or symmetric distribution; constant variance or a priori weights; locally linear or locally quadratic in numeric predictors; and neighborhood size.},

   abstract = {Surveying wildlife communities provides data for informing conservation and management decisions that affect multiple species. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) can efficiently gather community data for a variety of taxa, but generally require software algorithms to classify each recorded call to a species. Species classification errors are possible during this process and result in both false-negative and false-positive detections. Available approaches for analysing ARU data do not model the species classification probabilities, meaning erroneous detections are attributed to an omnibus source instead of the presence of another species. Additionally, counts of call recordings for each species are often summarized to binary detection data for analyses. Expanding statistical models to capture these nuances of ARU data would allow for improved inferences about occupancy and relative activity. Motivated by bat acoustic surveys, we developed a model to analyse counts of call recordings from multiple species simultaneously while accounting for species classification errors. Our model expands on previously developed false-positive occupancy models to better describe acoustic data. We used simulations to compare our model to other false-positive occupancy models for an example scenario with ARU data from two species. We also analyse acoustic data for eight bat species in Montana using our model. In simulations, single-species models resulted in biased estimates of occupancy and relative activity because they failed to associate false positives with the presence of the second species. Models analysing binary observations ignored available information on relative activity and led to less precise estimates. Applying our model to bat acoustic data from Montana allowed for species-specific estimates of occupancy and relative activity. This analysis illustrates the flexibility in our model framework while also highlighting the assumptions and data requirements for implementation. Specifically, additional information on the species classification probabilities is needed and we discuss considerations for reliably estimating these parameters. Directly modelling the species classification probabilities allows for improved ecological inferences for both occupancy and relative activity using community ARU data. Our statistical framework helps address the challenges posed by acoustic data, allowing ecologists to better utilize this technology to monitor wildlife communities.},

   abstract = {Ecologists often study biodiversity by evaluating species occupancy and the relationship between occupancy and other covariates. Occupancy models are now widely used to account for false absences in field surveys and to reduce bias in estimates of covariate relationships. Existing occupancy models take as inputs binary detection/non-detection observations of species at each visit to each site. However, autonomous sensing devices and machine learning models are increasingly used to survey biodiversity, generating a new type of observation record (i.e. continuous-score data) that reflects the model's confidence a species is present in each autonomously sensed file, instead of binary detection/non-detection data. These data are not directly compatible with traditional binary occupancy modelling methods. Here, we develop a new occupancy model that models continuous scores on a visit level as a Gaussian mixture, combining a distribution of scores for files that do contain the species of interest and a distribution of scores for files that do not. The model takes as input continuous scores for each autonomously sensed and classified file, along with an optional small number of binary, manually verified detection and non-detection annotations. We present a simulation study that shows that over a range of empirically realistic parameters, our model outperforms traditional occupancy models that are based on binary annotation alone. We also apply this new model to an empirical case study using data generated from five machine learning classifiers applied to autonomous acoustic recordings gathered in the eastern United States. Because our occupancy model generalizes allowable input data beyond binary observations, it is particularly well-suited to the increasing volume of machine learning classified data in ecology and conservation.},
